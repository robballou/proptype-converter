# Contributing to the PropType Converter

This project will currently accept PRs and issues. This project is looking for _common_ and _useful_ PropTypes that should be supported, bug fixes, and other coding issues.

- [Submit a PR](https://github.com/robballou/proptype-converter/compare)

Be aware that this is a personal project at the moment and the goal isn't necessarily to support _all_
PropTypes, just to give developers an easy Type they can start modifying.
